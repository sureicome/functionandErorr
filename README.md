# Lend Contract

This Solidity smart contract enables lending and repayment functionalities between a userIf on the Ethereum blockchain.
A userIf contract is a type of smart contract that allows two parties to make an agreement for the exchange of assets. in THis COntract We Have The userIf and the Borrower

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: using git clone

## Features

- **Lend**: The userIf can give funds to specified user.
- **Repay**: Borrowers can repay their loans.
  
## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Use the `FunctionANDError` function to userIf funds to borrowers.
3. Borrowers can use the `pay` function to repay the contract.

## Introduction

The `FunctionANDError` smart contract is designed to demonstrate various aspects of Solidity programming, including error handling, modifiers, mappings, and payable functions. This contract allows an owner to interact with user balances and transfer funds, incorporating custom errors to enhance readability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying or interacting with this contract, ensure you have:

- A basic understanding of Solidity and Ethereum smart contracts.
- An Ethereum development environment set up, preferably using Remix IDE or Truffle Suite.
- Familiarity with the concept of smart contract ownership and modifiers.

## Installation

This contract does not require installation but needs to be compiled and deployed to an Ethereum network. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the contract code into a `.sol` file.
2. Use a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix IDE or Truffle) to compile the contract.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to a local or testnet Ethereum network.

## Usage

Once deployed, the `FunctionANDError` contract offers several functionalities:

- **chick**: Allows adding a specified amount to a user's balance. Requires a non-zero address and a positive amount.
- **merro**: Returns the balance of a given user address. Reverts if the address is zero.
- **payuser**: Transfers a specified amount from the contract owner's balance to themselves. Only callable by the owner and ensures the requested amount is available.

## API Reference

### Functions

- **chick**: Adds `_num` to the balance of `_userIf`.
- **merro**: Returns the balance of `_address`.
- **payuser**: Transfers `_amount` from the contract owner's balance to themselves.

### Errors

- **CANT_WITHDRAW_THIS_AMOUNT**: Thrown when attempting to withdraw more funds than available.
- **BALANCE_OF_OWNER_MUST_BE_MORE_THAN_ZERO**: Ensures the contract owner's balance is greater than zero before withdrawal.

## Security Considerations

- **Ownership Modifier**: The `onlyowner` modifier ensures that only the contract creator can perform critical actions.
- **Payable Function**: The `chick` function is marked as `payable`, allowing it to receive Ether.
- **Revert Conditions**: Custom errors are used to provide clear feedback on why transactions might fail.

## Troubleshooting

- **Compilation Issues**: Ensure the Solidity version matches the pragma directive in the contract.
- **Deployment Failures**: Verify that the contract is being deployed to a supported network and that the deployment script is correctly configured.
